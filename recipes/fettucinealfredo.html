<h2> Description</h2>
<p>  Fettucine alfredo is tender pasta in a luscious cream sauce with garlic and fresh parmesan cheese. A classic Italian-American favorite, alfredo pasta is easy to make at home with simple ingredients</p>
<h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>5 chopped garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg  yolk</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.</li>
    </ol>
